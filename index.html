                RMS Titanic Trivia Facts:
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                RMS Titanic sunk in the wee hours of the morning on April 15th, 1912.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Titanic was captained by legendary seaman Edward John Smith. The Titanic's maiden voyage was to be his last at the helm before retiring with an impeccable service record.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wreck of the Titanic was found in 1985 by oceanographer Dr. Robert D. Ballard. A little known fact is that Dr. Ballard (a retired US Navy officer) used the search for the Titanic as a cover for a classified mission to find a sunken nuclear sub. The US government actually funded the search.

                The Titanic sunk after striking an iceberg just four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. For reasons we'll never know, the bridge crew of the Titanic chose to ignore many ice warnings that night. They were headed full speed into a tretcherous ice field, and they knew it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Titanic sank because the iceberg scraped along her side, rupturing 6 of her 15 watertight compartments. Ironically, if she had hit it head on instead of attempting to divert course, it's likely that only one or two of the watertight compartments would have been compromised, allowing her to stay afloat and be towed to harbor.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Titanic currently sits at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, in roughly 2.5 miles of water. The pressure at that depth is so high, only specially designed submersibles can reach it. There are only a handful of these submersibles in the world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Titanic had approximately 2200 passengers. Of these, only about 700 survived the disaster. Tragically, about 1500 people died that night. We'll never know the exact number because Titanic's passenger manifest was inaccurate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At the time Titanic was built, people equated number of funnels on a ship with speed, power, and grandeur. At that time, all the fastest, most powerful, and most luxurious ships had three funnels, while smaller ships only had one or two. Titanic's builders wanted to make her look more impressive, so they added a fourth "dummy" funnel. This funnel was not connected to the boilers like the other three, but it did provide some ventilation for the kitchens. Incidentally, this is why in every photo you ever see of the Titanic underway, you'll only see smoke coming from three of her stacks!
